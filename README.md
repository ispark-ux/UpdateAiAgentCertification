# AI Agent Certification Platform

**Flow**

1. **Admin → Processes → Add process**: name, customer name, opening line, **AI prompt** (the AI customer talks to the agent using this), evaluator notes (correct resolution etc.), scorecard (pre-filled with the standard 17 parameters / 100 marks, editable).
2. **Admin → Agents**: add agents (name, email, employee ID) to a process → **Send link** → the certification link is emailed to the agent.
3. **Admin → Certifications**: or create an open link for any process and copy it.
4. **Agent** opens the link → START → shares screen + mic → the **Gemini Live AI customer speaks first** → real call, recorded → END.
5. Transcript + audio + screen recording are uploaded → **Gemini audits** the call against the rubric → server computes the score → scorecard shown on the link **and emailed** to the configured To/CC (and the agent).
6. **Admin → Email settings**: SMTP host/port/user/password, From, To, CC, test email.

## Analytics & recertification (Admin → Analytics)

| Tab | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| **Certification analysis** | KPIs (links, completed, pass rate, average/median score, first-attempt vs recertification pass rate, ZTP breaches, avg call time), daily trend, score distribution, section-wise performance, weakest parameters, portal/CRM verification stats, full parameter table (C/NC/NA, NC rate, compliance, marks lost) - CSV export |
| **Process-wise** | Comparison table across processes (links, completed, pass rate, avg/min/max, certified agents, ZTP, top defect) + one card per process with section bars, top-5 defects, screen verdicts and trend - CSV export |
| **Agent-wise** | Every agent (incl. registered agents not started yet): status (Certified / Not certified / Failed (ZTP) / In progress / Link sent / Not started), attempts used vs. allowed, latest / best / first score, improvement, sparkline trend, focus areas from the latest attempt, attempt history, **Recertify** per agent and **Recertify all eligible** in one click - search, filters, sorting, CSV export |
| **Pareto** | 80/20 analysis with Pareto chart (bars + cumulative line + 80 % line), "vital few" vs "useful many", an action plan and table for: parameters by marks lost, parameters by defect count, sections by marks lost, portal/CRM checks by failures - CSV export |

Filters: process + period (7 / 30 / 90 / 365 days / all time). Supabase also gets SQL views `agent_certification_summary` and `parameter_results` for your own reporting (BI tools / SQL editor).

**Recertification**: each process has rules (enabled, max attempts per agent - default 3, cooldown hours). "Recertify" (certifications list, detail page, agent-wise tab) creates the next attempt for the same agent + process, linked to the first attempt (`attempt_no`, `recertification_of`), reuses an unused open link instead of creating duplicates, blocks while another attempt is in progress, and emails a "Recertification - attempt N" invite. Limits can be overridden by the admin (force).

## Run (PowerShell)

```powershell
npm install
Copy-Item .env.example .env     # set GEMINI_API_KEY (+ Supabase keys, see below)
npm run dev                     # http://localhost:3000  -> admin panel
# production: npm run build ; npm run start
```

Desktop Chrome/Edge over HTTPS or localhost (browser requirement for screen + mic capture).

## Supabase (recommended)

1. Supabase Dashboard → **SQL Editor** → paste **`supabase/schema.sql`** → Run (safe to re-run after every update - it only adds missing columns/views). It creates: `processes`, `agents`, `certification_sessions`, `certification_results`, `app_settings`, `email_logs`, the private storage bucket `recordings`, indexes, RLS and a `certification_overview` view.
2. Project Settings → API → copy the **Project URL** and the **service_role (secret) key**.
3. `.env`:
   ```
   SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxx.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJ...
   ```
4. Restart. The app now stores everything in Supabase (the SoTrue process is seeded automatically from `data/processes/sotrue.json` the first time the table is empty). Recordings are uploaded to the `recordings` bucket as `<SESSION_ID>/screen.webm` and `audio.webm` and played in the admin panel through signed URLs.

Without Supabase keys the app runs in **JSON-file mode** (`data/*.json`, `recordings/`) — same features, useful for local testing.

> Supabase free plan limits uploads to 50 MB per file; raise it under Project Settings → Storage if long screen recordings fail to upload (the score is still produced).

## Uploads & performance

- **No 413 errors - in any environment (Vercel included)**. A recording is never sent or stored as one request/object:
  1. **Direct**: the server returns one signed Supabase URL per **5 MB part** and the browser PUTs the parts straight to Supabase Storage (3 in parallel, retries). Nothing passes through Vercel, so its 4.5 MB request limit cannot apply. If storage itself answers 413 (bucket file-size limit), the upload is re-planned with half the part size, down to 64 KB.
  2. **Relay** (fallback / local mode): each part (1 MB, hard cap 4 MB) is POSTed to `/upload-part` and written directly as the final part object - **stateless**, no temp files, works across Vercel instances. A 413 from any proxy halves the part size automatically (down to 64 KB).
  3. `/upload-complete` verifies the stored byte count. Every playback response is ≤ 3 MB (HTTP ranges), so responses also stay under serverless limits.
  - On failure the agent can **Retry** or **Continue without screen video**.
- **Vercel needs Supabase**: Vercel's filesystem is read-only/ephemeral, so the JSON fallback cannot store anything there. Without `SUPABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` the app shows a red banner and refuses to create links with a clear message (instead of failing later).
- **Certification duration**: set per process (*Certification duration*, 1-120 min; optional *Minimum duration* - END is locked until then; *Warn before end*), and override per link (Certifications page / Agents page "Duration"). The agent sees elapsed / limit, time left and a progress bar, gets a "time almost up" alert, and the call **ends and submits automatically** at the limit. Gemini Live connections (recycled by Google about every 10 minutes) are **re-established automatically** in the background so long certifications continue seamlessly.
- **Light screen capture**: max 1920×1080, ~5 fps, VP8 @ 600 kbps (≈ 2–5 MB per minute, perfectly readable for the Gemini video analysis, low CPU so the live call stays responsive).
- **Half-duplex mic** (default on, per-process `live_settings.half_duplex`): while the AI customer is speaking, Gemini receives silence instead of the mic. This stops speaker→mic echo from making the AI interrupt itself and slow down over the call. The mixed conversation recording still contains the real mic audio. Turn-taking is tuned via `realtimeInputConfig` (end-of-speech sensitivity HIGH, 800 ms silence) - overridable per process (`end_of_speech_sensitivity`, `silence_duration_ms`, `prefix_padding_ms`).
- Hosting notes (Vercel): add `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (and optional `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`) as Environment Variables and redeploy. The evaluation route exports `maxDuration = 300` s for the background video analysis - keep Fluid Compute enabled (default) or use a plan that allows 300 s. Supabase free plan limits uploads to 50 MB per file - raise it under Project Settings → Storage for very long calls.

## Scorecard (default, editable per process)

| Section | Sub parameter | Marks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Opening (7) | Standard Call Opening · Acknowledgement | 5 · 2 |
| Soft Skills (54) | Professionalism **ZTP** · Empathy/Apology/Assurance · ROS/Clarity/Accent · Enthusiasm · Active listening · Grammar · Accurate Probing | 5 · 5 · 10 · 12 · 6 · 10 · 6 |
| Hold Procedure (10) | Hold Procedure · Transfer · Dead Air | 4 · 3 · 3 |
| Tagging (11) | CRM Disposition · Case Escalation | 6 · 5 |
| Resolution (10) | Correct and Complete Information | 10 |
| Closing (8) | Further Assistance · Closing script | 4 · 4 |

- Gemini returns C / NC / NA + marks + reason + verbatim evidence per parameter (strict JSON schema).
- Server clamps marks, verifies evidence against the real transcript, computes section totals, excludes NA from the denominator, and applies **ZTP**: an NC on a zero-tolerance parameter sets the score to 0 and fails the call.
- **Screen recording is analysed by Gemini** (two-stage evaluation): the `screen.webm` is uploaded to the Gemini Files API and Gemini watches the full recording against a **verification checklist built from the process**: portal opened (e.g. Shopify) → the **exact scenario ID searched** (e.g. `order_id: ST12345` from the customer profile; a different ID = fail with the value actually seen) → matching record opened → status/ETA read from the screen → CRM record opened for this customer → disposition selected → remarks added → saved → escalation (if required) → only work apps used. Each check gets `pass / fail / partial / unclear / not_applicable` + timestamp + evidence + value seen, plus a **cross-check**: what the screen showed vs. what the agent told the customer (`consistent / inconsistent`). The scorecard stage uses that: `fail` → NC, `partial` → partial marks, `unclear` → NA; Accurate Probing / Correct Information are corroborated against the screen. The full "Portal & CRM verification" report (verdicts, values seen, timeline, concerns) is on the result page, admin detail, dashboard list and in the result email.
- Evaluation runs in the background (`POST /evaluate` returns 202); the agent page and admin page poll the session and show the stage (uploading video → Gemini processing → watching screen → scoring → emailing). Typical time 1–5 minutes depending on call length.
- Optional env: `SCREEN_ANALYSIS_MODEL` (e.g. `gemini-2.5-pro` for better small-text reading), `SCREEN_MEDIA_RESOLUTION=MEDIA_RESOLUTION_HIGH`. Per process: expected portal/CRM actions (one per line) and an on/off switch for screen analysis.
